# Acetone

A Discord bot with a mission: eradicating the nail polish emoji.

# How?

Sorcery, mostly. And a bit of image processing. The bot will use pixel-by-pixel image analysis to detect the nail polish emoji, even under different names, and moderate messages that include it.

# Moderation

Messages containing the forbidden emoji will be promptly deleted. A summary of the deleted message will be sent to the postere in a DM.

Reactions to messages using the forbidden emoji will be removed.

There are no exceptions to this policy.

# Why?

I hate the nail polish emoji.
